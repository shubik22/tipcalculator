# Tippr

This is a basic tipping calculator application I built as part of my application to Codepath.  It calculates a tip amount and total bill amount (including tip) given a base bill amount and tip percentage.  It also allows you to set custom tip percentage defaults or round your tip amounts.  Given more time, I would add animations between views, better incorporate the custom keypad into the main view, split the bill amount between multiple people, finish adding unit tests, and add integration tests.

(Also, as you might be able to tell, design isn't my strongest suit, although I love working with talented designers; it'd also be nice to make it look better too.)

I probably spent 10 hours working on this, although I wasn't keeping track.

Required Stories:

* Basic tip calculator
* Custom tip percentages

Additional Stories:

* Rounding option for tip amount
* Custom keyboard for bill amount
* Bill amount and tip percentages saved in NSUserDefaults
* Clear/reset buttons
* Unit tests for main ViewController
